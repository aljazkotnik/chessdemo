# chessdemo
A chess data exploration example used to learn mobX

The chess example is used as large databases of games (n > 100.000) are available, with each game representing a time-varying small multiple with associated game metadata such as players and their ELO rankings, as well as the opening (part of game) classifications.


Aims of this project:
	- Familiarisation with mobX
	- Exploring time dependant small multiples dataset
	- Introduce traffic analysis and page usage tracking
